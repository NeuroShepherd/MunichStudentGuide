# About {#chapter-index}

I assume you're here because you were recently accepted to a university program in Munich or perhaps elsewhere in Germany; congratulations on your acceptance, and best of luck with the transition to your new program!

This book primarily aims to assist any prospective students hoping to move to Munich for their bachelors, masters, and/or PhD programs with a particular focus on the needs of international students. However, the content within covers topics that are broadly applicable to people relocating from abroad and even within Germany. Wherever possible, I have tried to exhaustively cover topics relevant to the **initial relocation** process to Munich, from finding apartments to visas to banking.

## Contents

The content are arranged in approximate chronological order of how they should be completed, and the book is split into three major sections: pre-arrival post-arrival activities. However, some topics cannot be strictly completed at one timepoint, I have endeavored to clarify this wherever possible.

## Contributing

I welcome any additional details, methods, and other contributions to this book that you might provide!

As I have only relocated from abroad to Germany once in my life, I can neither say the experiences nor information I provide here is the definitive truth or the only way to accomplish relocating. Moreover, I documented as many of the procedures as I could at the time of my relocation, but I almost certainly failed to write down every piece of information that might be of interest to others and so there are likely small gaps that others could fill in.

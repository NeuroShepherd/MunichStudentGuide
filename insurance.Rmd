## Haftplichtversicherung

- Liability insurance
- Very cheap at around €60/year. yes, per year.
- Not legally mandatory, but should consider it de facto mandatory. Do not skip. Provides millions in coverage in case you get sued for something.

## Allgemeine Sachversicherung

- general property insurance
- similar to homeowner's and/or rental insurance for things you own if they're stolen, damaged, destroyed, etc.
- much lower priority than Haftplichtversicherung, but comes at a similar cost for tens of thousands of euros in coverage. so in the very unfortunate event that your apartment burns down, for exmaple, you will be reimbursed for the items you own.
  - make sure to occassionally photograph your belongings so you actually know what you own

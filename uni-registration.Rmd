# University Registration 

Congratulations! I assume you're here because you were recently accepted to a program in Munich, perhaps at Ludwig Maximilian Universit√§t (LMU), the Technical University of Munich (TUM), or another 


## Important Documents

- unsurprisingly, the uni offices will require documents to prove your previous education and credentials. by this point, you have likely already had to provide digital copies of these documents as part of the application procedure.
- some Unis (looking at you LMU) still require paper documents after the online application. In such cases, you will absolutely not be able to register with the university until you have the documents, and there are deadlines for university registration that you must adhere to.

### Typical Documents

- previous diplomas
  - surprisingly, high school degrees are requested (at least up until masters degree programs)
  - bachelors degrees
  - masters degrees
- official university degrees
- acceptance letter from the department
- acceptance letter from the international office (LMU, likely applicable elsewhere too)

### Certified Copies

- need to obtain certified copies. in Germany, this is referred to as "Beglaubigte" document, and is also known as a notarized copy of the document(s)
- **German universities have special regulations for students who attended uni in certain countries**. That is, the requirements and scrutiny around students who went to uni in e.g. Pakistan and Iran is incredibly strict. Please look (HERE) for more information on this topic.
- **Documents that need to be certified must either be provided as certified copies from your university registrar or notarized by a notary public. I cannot recommend enough that you obtain multiple notarized/certified copies of such documents before departing for Germany.**
  - In my case, I had a photocopy of my diploma and my university provides digital certified diplomas which are *supposed to be* valid, recognized copies of the document. In Germany, the are not; you **must** have certified paper copies if they are requested.

### Delivery

- double-check address
- if there are multiple addresses, send an email to confirm which one because the wrong office is not guaranteed to process or even pass-along incorrectly mailed documents
- pay for tracked, certified, or similar mail. yes, it's much more expensive than spending a few USD (or equivalent currency) for a standard flat rate letter. Don't be me. I cheaped out, the mail was never delivered, and it wound up costing me far more time and money than the initial ~$30 savings.

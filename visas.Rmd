# Visas {#chapter-visas}

## General Info

A quick note on terminology: _visas_ are documents allowing legal entry to a country for a specified purpose and period of time. These are distinct from residence permits which, as the name implies, state that you are officially a resident (of some status) of the country in question. Visas are obtained prior to initial entry, and residence permits can, in general, only be obtained **after** entry to the country. 

Unfortunately, the issue of visas is more complex than this book can reasonably cover, and I will generally direct readers to Google or their closest German consulate/embassy to sort out this issue. However, I will provide some very brief information based on the nationality of the reader.

### EU Citizens

Congrats, you don't have to do anything to enter Germany as a student! You likely already knew this, however.

### "Schengen Friends" 

The "Schengen Friends" are countries which are not formally part of the Schengen zone, but have special agreements with Schgengen/EU countries allowing citizens of these countries to enter the zone without a visa (initially) and to stay in the zone for 90 out of any 180 day period. Such members include:

* The United Kingdom
* The United States
* Canada
* Japan
* South Korea
* Australia
* Most countries in Latin America

A complete lsit of such countries can be found at this [Wiki page on the Schengen visa policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_policy_of_the_Schengen_Area).

Traditionally, citizens of these countries **do not** need to apply for specific student visas. In fact, some Germany embassies/consulates explicitly discourage these nationals from making appointments or otherwise attempting to obtain student visas. Instead, official recommendations have been to simply arrive in Germany on a Schengen tourist visa, and to apply for the student residence permit upon arrival


### Third Party Nationals

If you are neither a citizen of an EU/Schengen country nor the "Schengen Friends" above, then you will need to contact your local German embassy or consulate to make an appointment for obtaining a student visa.
